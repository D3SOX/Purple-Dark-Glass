# 🔍 Transparency

If you use Powercord it is recommended to enable transparency.  
You can find the transparency setting under:

    - Advanced Settings
      - Transparent Window

# ⚠️ Notes

- Purple Dark Glass is a dark theme only, using light mode will result in the default discord theme being used
